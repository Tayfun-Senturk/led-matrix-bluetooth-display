# üî≤ Bluetooth-Controlled LED Matrix Display

A microcontroller-based system that displays animations and scrolling text on an 8x32 LED matrix via Bluetooth using an ESP32 microcontroller. The project includes custom animations like Pac-Man, heartbeats, and waveform visualizations, which can be triggered via a Unity-based mobile application.
